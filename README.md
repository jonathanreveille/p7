This is project 7 of Openclassrooms - Grandpy Bot

Ask a question to Grandpy and he will tell you a story about it !

This project is part of the openclassroom python course. In this
project, we had to create a Flask application. This involves creating
the back end and the front end in separate part.

The back end will handle to retrieve the data from the user's question
by using regular expression.
The back end will handle web services API with GoogleMaps and MediaWiki.

This project has to be TDD. Test should be done before coding the most
possible way. I decided to carry on with pytest for this project in 
order to respect this rule.

In this project, you will see test units and also mocks, to imitate answers
from an API service.

This project is coded in python 3.7 and it involves : 
Use of Flask Framework.
Use of Google Maps API.
Use of MediaWiki API.
Use of Regular expression.

If you want to run this project, you need to get yourself a GoogleKey
in order to be able to use their services.

I would like to thank my mentor for all the help and explanations
he provided to me !
